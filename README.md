# Michael's Home Configs

These are some home directory configurations I have.  They are provided by [Home-Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) and also by [Hjem](https://github.com/feel-co/hjem).

Home-Manager is a well-known and widely used for a variety of user-space management and configurations.  Provides a lot of modules and options for declarative management.

Hjem is a newer, simpler version of file linking.  Useful for providing only declarative and collected dotfile management without the overhead, complexity, and potential breakage that home-manager has.
