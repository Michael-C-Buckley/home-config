# Michael's Home Configs

These are some home directory configurations I have.  They are provided by [Home-Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) and also by [Hjem](https://github.com/feel-co/hjem).

## Home-Manager

Home-Manager is a well-known and widely used for a variety of user-space management and configurations.  Provides a lot of modules and options for declarative management.

I am currently using home-manager for declarative management on graphical, personal computers for complex application management.

## Hjem

Hjem is a newer, simpler version of file linking.  Useful for providing only declarative and collected dotfile management without the overhead, complexity, and potential breakage that home-manager has.

This implementation is primarily for my servers, where I don't have or need extensive applications and their configurations.
